Year3 SETU Project:
In the modern world, where the population is growing and, cities and towns are becoming denser (CSO Ireland, n.d.), it is becoming more challenging to know the surrounding neighbours and spot any suspicious activity that might be out of the norm. In the 21st century, it is more common than ever that people stick to their connection to the internet through their mobile devices and often ignore the outside world.
While this brings with it negatives, it also has some positives, and it could be hard to contact the homeowner in the case of an emergency, but now they are only a call/text away. A Modern connected home alarm system can leverage the connected world, providing an extra layer of protection and supplying the tent/homeowner peace of mind as they can check the system's status anywhere in the world with connectivity.
The objective of this home alarm is to provide a system that can take multiple sensors in a scalable fashion, read and make a decision from that data, which results in defined actions to be taken by the system. i.e., prompt the user for input, and notify the user of a state change.
To achieve a modem system for 2023, it must be (Aliza Vigderman, 2023)
a.	Low Cost.
b.	Wireless.
c.	Scalable.
d.	Send clear and concise updates to the end user.
e.	Self-contained.
